      "The project work focused more towards developing a metadata application portal that links existing on premise metadata resource information with native GCP metadata tools into one secure web-based application with enhanced search and visualization capabilities and without replicating or duplicating the information that already exists in other metadata tools. With these attributes data users can create use case requests which will be sent to google big query and creation of auth views with requested data and views. After these entitlements are created in Google Big Query, users are given access to these through Service Now Portal integration layer in the form of API requests after proper approval from data approvers",
